        The Website merely provides a marketplace where you can view
        Accommodation/Activity, contact Hosts/Activity Operators in relation to
        enquiries or any questions you may have or make bookings for
        Accommodation/Activity. We do not, to the extent permitted by law,
        accept any liability in connection with any contract you enter into with
        a Host/Activity Operator or for any accommodation you rent or activity
        you book, except to the extent that we collect tax information and/or
        levy residence tax on behalf of the Host/Activity Operator. In addition,
        to the extent permitted by law, we do not accept any liability for the
        acts or omissions of Hosts/Activity Operators, or any other person or
        party connected with the Accommodation/Activity. The contract for all
        Accommodation/Activity is with the Host/Activity Operator. His terms and
        conditions will apply to your booking. These terms and conditions may
        limit and/or exclude the liability of Hosts/Activity Operators to you.
        You are therefore advised to read them carefully before booking. We do
        not provide liability insurance for Hosts/Activity Operators or
        Guests/Participants. This applies regardless of whether a user takes out
        insurance cover through one of our third-party Hosts/Activity Operators.
        Guests/Participants are advised to take out appropriate travel insurance
        to cover the booking, including in the event that the booking has to be
        cancelled. Guests/Participants must ensure that the insurance cover is
        sufficient and appropriate for their particular needs. As a consumer you
        have certain rights (including the right to require that we provide our
        services with reasonable care and skill). Nothing in these Terms and
        Conditions affects your statutory rights. Explore Cultural Learning is
        liable as a hosting host if Explore Cultural Learning is at fault.
        Explore Cultural Learning will be liable for any loss or damage you
        suffer which is a foreseeable result of a breach of these Terms or a
        lack of reasonable care and skill on our part. However, to the extent
        permitted by law, we will not be liable for any loss or damage which is
        not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is either obvious
        that it will occur or if, at the time of entering into these Terms and
        Conditions, both we and you knew that it might occur, such as in cases
        where you have spoken to us about it. Explore Cultural Learning shall
        not be liable, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for any claim,
        cause of action, recovery, loss, damage, fine, penalty or other cost or
        expense of any kind, including reasonable legal costs (“Claims”),
        brought or incurred by any third party in connection with (a) any
        material or content you provide to the Website; (b) your use of any
        content on the Website; (c) any breach by you of these Terms and
        Conditions; or (d) your use of the Accommodation/Activity. Explore
        Cultural Learning will promptly notify you of any such claim. If you are
        dissatisfied with the Site (or Explore Cultural Learning platform or
        systems) or do not agree with any part of these Terms and Conditions,
        your sole and exclusive remedy against Explore Cultural Learning is to
        discontinue using the Site. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall
        be deemed to exclude or limit the liability of thExplore Cultural
        Learning in respect of death or personal injury caused by its negligence
        or in respect of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of
        the Explore Cultural Learning. Furthermore, the above exclusions and
        limitations do not apply to Explore Cultural Learning&apos;s breach of
        material contractual obligations (cardinal obligations). Cardinal
        obligations within the meaning of these Terms and Conditions are those
        obligations that enable the proper performance of the contract and the
        achievement of its purpose in the first place and on whose compliance
        the Guest/Participant may therefore regularly rely. In the event of a
        breach of cardinal obligations, Explore Cultural Learning shall only be
        liable for the damage typical of the contract and foreseeable at the
        time of the conclusion of the contract. The exclusions or limitations
        also do not apply in the case of damage caused intentionally or by gross
        negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation of the Explore
        Cultural Learning and claims arising from the Product Liability Act as
        well as other statutory guaranteed liability and guarantees expressly
        granted by exploreculturallearning.com. Otherwise, liability for damages
        caused by slight negligence is excluded. Refunds will be processed
        immediately, but the timing of receipt of a refund will depend on the
        payment method and the relevant payment system. Refunds will be made in
        the currency in which the original payment was made. Any currency
        conversion will be done by the relevant bank using the current exchange
        rate, which may differ from the exchange rate used for the original
        payment. Furthermore, bank charges which may have been incurred by the
        Guest/Participant during the booking process or as part of the refund
        process may be deducted by the bank from the amount refunded and in such
        cases will not be refunded by exploreculturallearning.com.
